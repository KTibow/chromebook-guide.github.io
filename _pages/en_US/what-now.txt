"What now?"

That's a question that I've been asked time and time again after helping someone complete this guide. This page is a non-exhaustive guide of a bunch of things you can (but not necessarily everything you should) do.

## Anonymize your Network Traffic

Assuming you followed the reccomended instructions while unenrolling and fakemurking your chromebook, you'll have installed a few murkmod plugins. There are two that we're looking at here: `wssocks.sh` and `mac-randomizer.sh`.

Open up mush (`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and go to the plugins menu (option 4). Select "Randomize Mac Address". Just in case something messes up later, write down the text after "Current MAC:" and keep it in a safe place.

Now, select `5` to randomize the last 5 bytes of your MAC address.

If you're really, really paranoid about being tracked, you can also use wssocks to further anonymize your traffic over a proxy. Quit from the MAC Address Randomizer and select the plugins menu again. Now, select "Manage proxy connections". Press enter to accept the default proxy, if you don't want to selfhost.

After a couple of seconds, everything should load and you should be good to go. Head to your network settings and point your SOCKS5 proxy towards `localhost:1080`. You should instantly see connections popping up on your dashboard, and you'll be able to use the internet like normal.

## Take Some Screenshots

If you are familiar with the r/unixporn community, you'll know that there are two parts to a linux screenshot: the neofetch output and the terminal. We have both, so why not take a beautiful screenshot?

Head to your plugins menu and select "Run Neofetch". Get this in a screenshot and you'll be the talk of the town.

## Serialize your Chromebook

Let me get started by saying that this is not a good idea on a Chromebook that you're going to have to give back at the end of the year. This is an irreverable process and will make Google's servers permanently think your Chromebook is a completely different device. This is only provided here in the not-so-rare chance that you bought an enrolled chromebook from a reseller, and the reseller refuses to unenroll the device.

First, we're going to need another murkmod plugin. Install the following:

```
serialization-util.sh
```

Then, open the serialization utility from the plugins menu. Provide a new serial number where prompted, and your device will reboot.

## Boot from a USB

Open MrChromebox's Firmware Utility from the plugins menu. After a short bit of loading (20 seconds or so), you'll be presented with a menu. If you want to boot from a USB drive, all you should need to do is install the RW/LEGACY firmware, and, optionally, the full UEFI firmware as well.

Then, reboot your device (`Refresh+Power`) and press `Ctrl+L` at the developer mode warning screen, with a USB drive plugged in.

## Override Admin-Set Wallpaper

Open the wallpaper manager plugin and follow the prompts, supplying the path to your new wallpaper (which should be located in your Downloads folder). You should see changes immediately. If not, reboot and log in again.

## Use Crouton

In mush, select option 13 to install Crouton. After 15 minutes or so of loading, you should be prompted for a username and password. Provide them, and setup will be completed automatically.

Then, back in mush, select option 14 to start Crouton. Wait about 30 seconds, and you'll be dropped into a shiny new XFCE desktop environment.

To switch back and forth between desktops, press `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Back` and `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Forward`.
