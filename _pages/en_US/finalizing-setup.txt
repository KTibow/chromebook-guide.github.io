## Section I - Disable Extensions (if neccecary)

You can skip this step if you already installed murkmod.

Try to open crosh (`Ctrl+Alt+T`). If you can't open crosh due to an extension block, then create a new folder in your Downloads named `disable-extensions`. Fakemurk will automagically disable extensions so you can use crosh.

## Section II - Install Reccomended Murkmod Plugins

This section is only appliccable if you installed murkmod.
{: .notice--info}

Open crosh (`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and select "Install Plugins". Type the following lines at the prompt, one at a time:

```
mrchromebox-fwscript.sh
neofetch.sh
wallpaper.sh
wssocks.sh
mac-randomizer.sh
fakeapk.sh
q
```

FakeAPK is an incredibly useful tool when it comes to fakemurked Chromebooks. If you chose not to install murkmod, then you can install it with:
`sudo curl -LOk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clockworkindustries/FakeAPK/main/fakeapk.sh && sudo bash fakeapk.sh
` from a root shell.

## Section III - Disable Admin-Installed Extensions

Hard-disabling and hard-enabling extensions is a time-consuming process. If you're under surveilance unpredictably, you might want to be able to quickly toggle on and off certain extensions. Leave these extensions hard-enabled, then see the [LtBEEF Guide](ltbeef)
{: .notice--info}

Select "Hard Disable Extensions" and, at the prompt, enter the extension ID corresponding to the extension you want to disable (only applies for murkmod, fakemurk alone will allow you to disable only a few of these extensions):

- GoGuardian - `haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh`
- Securly - `iheobagjkfklnlikgihanlhcddjoihkg` (webstore extension) or `joflmkccibkooplaeoinecjbmdebglab` (non-webstore extension)

## Section IV - Install RW_LEGACY firmware

Select Plugins (option 4 in murkmodded mush) and select "Run MrChromebox's firmware utility script". After a short bit of loading, it will present you with a menu that looks like this:

![]({{ "./images/mrchromeboxfw.png" | absolute_url }})

Select option 1, and the firmware will be installed. Then, press `Q` to quit.

## Section V - Setup APK installation and AuroraStore

Select Plugins and select "Install/Uninstall FakeAPK". At the menu, select `1` (Enable FakeAPK). When prompted, press enter to reboot. Upon rebooting, sign back in and download the [Aurora Store APK](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore/uploads/bbc1bd5a77ab2b40bbf288ccbef8d1f0/AuroraStore_4.1.1.apk). Find it in your Downloads folder and double-click it. After a short wait, it will prompt you to confirm installing an "unsecure app". Click Continue, and installation will commence. Confirm installation if prompted, and then launch the Aurora Store app from your launcher (press the `Search` key). It will prompt you to perform initial configuration. Leave the default value for everything (except the color theme, feel free to mess with that). When prompted to log in, just select "Log in with Google" and sign in with your home account.
