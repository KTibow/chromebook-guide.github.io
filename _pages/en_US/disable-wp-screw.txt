{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

## Prerequisites

- A screwdriver, small enough to take off the back of your Chromebook

## Section I - Opening the Device

This part shouldn't be hard: just pop open the back of your Chromebook with a screwdriver.

## Section II - Identifying the Screw

Find a single isolated screw on your motherboard. It might or might not be covered in a piece of tape. [This guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG4ZWbimONQ) has an excellent tutorial that you can follow for your own device, if you have an Acer Chromebook.

## Section III - Close It Back Up

Put the shell back on. Screw everything back together, then continue.

## Section II - Next Steps

Now, continue on the exploit chain to [Sh1mmer Unenrollment](sh1mmer).
