## Prerequisites

- A USB drive, 8gb or larger, for the modified shim

## Section I - Download a Raw Shim

You need to download a raw RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) shim for your board, which you found earlier. There are only a few of these that have been publicly leaked, and this tool automatically filters out boards that are not supported. You can get a shim at the following sites:

- https://files.ultimatesrv.com/
- https://rainestorme.github.io/chrome81/

## Section II - Add the SH1MMER payload (BeautifulWorld)

Visit the [SH1MMER Web Builder](https://sh1mmer.me/builder.html) and upload your raw shim. Wait a couple of minutes for it to build, then download the result.

## Section III - Flash the Shim

Got your built shim? Great! Now, there are some differing instructions depending on your platform.

### On *nix

On a ChromeOS device in developer mode, you can also use the following instructions to flash the drive. Otherwise, you can download the [Chromebook Recovery Utility]() from the Chrome Webstore and use that to flash the drive. Just click on the top right button in the window and select "Use Local File", then select your .bin file. This probably won't work on an enrolled device, but if the extension is unblocked, you can do it entirely on that Chromebook.
{: .notice--info}

Good choice of operating system, by the way. Most distros will come with the `dd` utility built-in. If yours doesn't, then choose a different distro or find a way to flash the recovery image. Run the following command, making sure that you have the correct /dev path to your USB drive and the correct path to your recovery image:

```sh
dd if=/path/to/sh1mmer.bin of=/dev/sdX
```

In a few minutes, you should be done, and the command should exit with a 0 exit code.

### On Windows

Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and run the executable. Select the .bin file you just downloaded and select your USB drive. Click on flash and follow the prompts. If asked, select "Flash in DD mode".

### On MacOS

Download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) and run the excutable. Select the .bin file and your USB drive. Click on flash and follow the prompts.

## Section IV - Boot SH1MMER

Boot your Chromebook and press and hold `Esc+Refresh+Power` for one second. Then, press `Ctrl+D`. At the next screen, press `Refresh+Power`. Now, plug in your USB drive and press `Esc+Refresh+Power` again. After a short loading screen, the SH1MMER menu should load. 

## Section V - Unenroll

If you were on a version >111 and disabled WP, you will need to run some commands before anything will work. Otherwise, just past these pargraphs and unenroll normally. Open a bash shell (Utilities > Bash Shell) and run the following command:

```sh
futility gbb --flash -s --flags=0x8090
```

This will set the GBB (Google Binary Block) flags on your system to allow unenrollment and devmode.

Select the first option on the menu and you will be presented with a menu with a variety of payloads and utilities. What we're after is "Un-Enroll Device". Select it and reboot your device (`Esc+Refresh`). Then, unplug your USB drive and setup your device as normal.

Your device will now behave as a normal, personal device would, free of any restrictions.

Your administrator wil be able to see that your device is "offline", and you should spend as little time as possible in this state if you are not authorized to be following this tutorial.

## Section VI - Next Steps

If you want to re-enroll but keep your Chromebook unrestricted, continue to [fakemurk](fakemurk)
{: .notice--success}

...or you could just keep your device like this, and use it as a personal device. The choice is yours.
